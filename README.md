  <h1> About:
  <h5> As a part of a team, we are building a restaurant ordering system, this was my part to design and build the mobile view which the customers will be interacting with. It was made in react with modal windows and JS animations with TailwindCSS as a CSS framework, and firebase to store the data.
     
    
  <h1> Disclaimer:
  <h5> If You want to view how it is supposed to look, please inspect element and view in any mobile phone view. It should be responsive enough to accomodate any mobile formfactor.
<h1> How to use:
      <h5> <ol><li>Open the website which is hosted with gh-pages link: https://tarik1700.github.io/SNART-project/ 
        <li>To use this on the desktop, the website is responsive enough to accomodate any resolution but it will not look as intended. If you want to view it on a desktop screen you can inspect and toggle device toolbar. 
        <li>The code that you need to input is randomized and unique for each session. To get your unique code, just press submit and it will pop up as an alert. Even though that might seem pointless, it is a functionality that can be used later on for further security. 
        <li>You're in! you can now make orders as you wish and create orders. 
        <li>The current app is connected to a free firebase project, so please try not to overload it with many orders for no reason. Thank you!
