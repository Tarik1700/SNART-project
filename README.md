  <h1> About:
  <h5> As a part of a team, we are building a restaurant ordering system, this was my part to design and build the mobile view which the customers will be interacting with. It was made in react with modal windows and JS animations with TailwindCSS as a CSS framework, and firebase to store the data .
   
  <h1> Disclaimer:
  
  <h5> If You want to view how it is supposed to look, please inspect element and view in any mobile phone view. It should be responsive enough to accomodate any mobile formfactor. It is public for testing purposes, and it is not yet finished.
